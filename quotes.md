A few quotes that portray qualities dear to my heart...

Rational

In God I trust. Everyone else must bring data.
-W. Edwards Deming

Persistence

Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent
-Calvin Coolidge

Integrity

Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them.”
-Brene Brown

Resilience

A Ship in Harbor Is Safe, But that Is Not What Ships Are Built For
-John A. Shedd

Optimism

The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.
― William Arthur Ward

The optimist thinks this is the best of all possible worlds. The pessimist fears it is true.
-J. Robert Oppenheimer

Teamwork

If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
-Albert Einstein
